The Aadhaar Demand Predictor and Trend Analyzer utilizes the 2025 UIDAI dataset for enrollment, demographics, and biometric updates. After performing data cleaning and transformation, I analyzed enrollment and update trends grouped by state using trivalent analysis. The study investigated whether Aadhaar demand is random or driven by common seasonal and academic factors. I proposed a geographic-based demand forecasting solution to make the system more scalable. This approach leads to resource optimization increases of 20% to 30% by aligning capacity with expected demand.
